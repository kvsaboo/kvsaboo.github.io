The complexity and heterogeneity of the disease; sparse longitudinal data; and unknown relationships among factors such as disease pathology, brain structures, brain activity, and cognition present significant challenges in predicting disease progression.\nWe have developed models that provide a holistic view of disease progression by combining ML with multimodal data and clinical domain knowledge in the form of science-based differential equations (DEs). Basing the model on DEs provides biological interpretability to the results and using ML improves the model’s data fitting capacity.\nThe models predict personalized 5- to 10-year future cognitive decline in older adults, thus providing a tool to identify at-risk individuals. Our methods have also yielded novel insights into the physiological basis of compensatory processes that mitigate the effect of disease on cognition.

Patients with drug resitant epilepsy become candidates for surgical resection of brain tissue suspected to be the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data is collected from these patients to localize the seizure onset zone, which is done by manually or semi-automatically scanning through hours of iEEG recordings. iEEG data presents several challenges for the development of automated techniques such as high-dimensionality, non-stationarity, and heterogeneity of SOZ across patients.\nWe have discovered iEEG biomarkers and developed ML methods to addresses two important clinicals challenges: (i) SOZ localization, and (ii) predicting seizure clustering. We observed that relative entropy, a bivariate iEEG feature which represents the similarity in brain activity between pairs of iEEG electrodes, is a suitable biomarker for the above tasks. Relative entropy also enables abstracting streams of iEEG data into time-evolving graphs - rendering the data suitable for application of graph theoretical techniques.\nRelevant publications\nK. V.

Answering this question can potentially help in developing brain stimulation techniques that enhance memory in patients suffering from memory loss, for e.g., in traumatic brain injury.\nWe addressed the above question using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data collected from epilepsy patients as they performed a short term memory task. In the task, patients were requested to learn and recall lists of words, while iEEG data was collected when patients were shown the words.\nWe developed automated techniques to identify implanted electrodes measuring memory related activity. The methods are orders of magnitude faster than currently used semi-automated techniques with over 95% accuracy. On data from over 100 people with more than 12,000 electrodes, the methods led to the discovery of a novel brain region for memory processing and helped predict individualized memory performance.\nRelevant publications\nC.
