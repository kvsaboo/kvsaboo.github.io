I am a part of the DEPEND group at CSL and I am advised by Prof. Ravishankar K. Iyer. My research leverages machine learning to understand neurological disorders and to develop tools for diagnosing and treating them. For my disseration projects, I have collaborated with Dr. Gregory Worrell (Mayo Clinic), Prof. Michal Kucewicz (Mayo Clinic), Dr. Prashanthi Vemuri (Mayo Clinic), and Dr. Jasmohan Bajaj (VCU).\nI graduated with a B.Tech. and M.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in Electrical Engineering with specialisation in Communications and Signal Processing. My thesis was with Prof. Vivek Borkar on topics in semi-supervised learning and resource allocation.\nI am broadly interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning, neurology, and neuroscience. My goal is to develop and apply machine learning techniques to (i) delineate the relationships among brain, disorders, and cognition; and (ii) develop tools for assisting clinicians in diagnosing and providing care.\nNews\n 09/21: Our work on a RL-based Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease progression model got accepted in NeurIPS 2021.
