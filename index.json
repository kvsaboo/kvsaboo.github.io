I am a part of the DEPEND group at CSL and am advised by Prof. Ravishankar K. Iyer. My research leverages machine learning to understand neurological disorders and to develop tools for diagnosing and treating them. For my disseration, I have worked on Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy in collaboration with Dr. Gregory Worrell (Mayo Clinic), Prof. Michal Kucewicz (Mayo Clinic), Prof. Prashanthi Vemuri (Mayo Clinic), and Dr. David Jones (Mayo Clinic). I have also worked with Dr. Jasmohan Bajaj (VCU) on analysing the relationship between gut microbiome, liver cirrhosis, and cognitive decline.\nI graduated with a B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I specialised in Communications and Signal Processing. My thesis was with Prof. Vivek Borkar on topics in semi-supervised learning and resource allocation.\nI am broadly interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning, neurology, and neuroscience. My goal is to develop and apply machine learning techniques to (i) delineate relationships among brain structure and activity, brain disorders, and cognition; and (ii) develop tools for assisting clinicians in disease diagnosis and intervention.\nRecent News\n08/2022: Awarded the Young Investigator Award at AES 2022 Annual Meeting. 06/2022: Our Journal of Hepatology 2022 paper was chosen as a landmark paper by the European Association for the Study of the Liver. 02/2022: Our work on using deep learning to identify brain structures that explain heterogeneity in cognitive aging got accepted in NeuroImage. 11/2021: Our work on differences between stool and saliva microbiome in predicting cirrhosis got published in the Journal of Hepatology. 11/2021: Awarded Paul D.
