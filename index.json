I am a part of the DEPEND group at CSL and I am advised by Prof. Ravishankar K. Iyer. My research leverages machine learning to understand neurological disorders and to develop tools for diagnosing and treating them. I collaborate with Dr. Gregory Worrell (Mayo Clinic), Prof. Michal Kucewicz (Mayo Clinic), Dr. Prashanthi Vemuri (Mayo Clinic), and Dr. Jasmohan Bajaj (VCU).\nI graduated with a B.Tech. and M.Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in Electrical Engineering with specialisation in Communications and Signal Processing. My thesis was with Prof. Vivek Borkar on topics in semi-supervised learning and resource allocation.\nNews\n 06/20: Our work on gender difference in gut microbiome of cirrhosis patients got accepted in the Journal of Hepatology.
